# Clinic Managment System
This project aims, after an overview of the health care system and welfare Albanian to examine,
based on the current organizational structure of the same, what can be the possible
improvements could be implemented in this area of fundamental importance to the national health department such as medical records being on paper and people waiting in long lines, we came up with the idea of creating a Web-based Application to digitalize the way the public hospitals in our country work.

Our project will be based on these main points:

•	Leaving appointments online

•	Keeping medical records of each patient in digital form

•	Showing medical personnel timetables

• Agenda of each Doctor

• Drug Recipe

The implementation of the idea will work closely with polyclinics by having constant contact. Patients , which will have their own account in our system, will be the ones to set appointments on doctor’s timetable and doctors can share the medical records with the patient. After the specialist doctor finishes the appointments, updated patient records are sent back for download.

Each doctor will have his/her own account where he/she can add patients, set new appointments, write appointment notes which are added to patient records, check the medical records of a patient.

Receptionist have access on all profiles,they can edit personal information but cannot make use of them for any other purpose.
